              <h3>Downtown Crossing's Bio</h3>
                <p>Born in the fires of The Vocal Revolution chorus, Downtown Crossing is a youthful quartet dedicated to bringing fun and energy to barbershop music. They are the 2013 Northeasten District Champions.</p>

                <p><strong>Tenor, Seth Orenstein:</strong> Seth was first introduced to barbershop music at ten years old by his barbershopping grandfather. It wasn’t long before Seth was listening to groups like ‘The Boston Common’ and ‘Bluegrass Student Union.’ Although his introduction to the genre happened early, it wasn’t until eleven years later that he finally decided to get involved in the music he had been listening to for so long. In 2010 Seth paid a visit to the Vocal Revolution barbershop chorus. After ringing just one tag he realized what he had been missing. Since then he has become a front-row member of the chorus, member of the music team, and tenor of ‘Downtown Crossing’. He has acquired five man-of-note pins, two of which were his brother and father.</p>

                <p><strong>Lead, Joey Constantine:</strong> After one year of 'playing' the clarinet in the middle school band, Joey quickly realized that the only instrument he needed was his voice! He has performed in various vocal ensembles since his early woodwind education, including being invited to perform in the All Eastern Chorus in 2004. At Westfield State, he sang a cappella and played guitar in several acoustic ensembles while pursuing a degree in Communications. Back at home with mom, dad, and a bachelors degree in hand, he searched far and wide for music fulfillment and found that 4-part harmony was waiting for him! Outside of singing, Joey works as an assistant property manager in Cambridge. He also enjoys craft beer and swimming. Separately, of course.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Baritone, Dan Costello:</strong> Dan has been singing barbershop for 16 years thanks to his Grandfather John, who introduced him to this awesome hobby. Dan is a certified Director of the Barbershop Harmony Society and currently directs the Vocal Revolution (formally "Sounds of Concord") barbershop chorus, 2011 & 2012 Northeastern District Chorus Champions and 2013 Northeastern District representative at the Barbershop Harmony Society's International Chorus Contest. Believe it or not, barbershop is not Dan's day job, though he wishes it were! Dan works for Clean Harbors Environmental Services at their corporate office in Norwell.</p>

                <p><strong>Bass, Ben Orenstein:</strong> Ben can be found Assistant Directing the Vocal Revolution barbershop chorus, singing bass in Downtown Crossing, and occasionally even in tune. He is the oldest, tallest, and hairiest member of the quartet. When not singing roots and fifths, Ben works as a software engineer, minutes from Downtown Crossing's namesake.</p>

                    <h4>About Us</h4>
                    <p>Downtown Crossing is four guys with a passion for entertaining people. You're just as likely to hear us singing on the T as on stage. All our friends call us DTX, so you should too! Much to Nashville's dismay, Downtown Crossing is an officially registered quartet of the Barbershop Harmony Society.</p>
